# Repository instructions

`AGENTS.md` is a symlink to this file. Maintain one shared instruction source. Write agent instructions, skills, supporting references, and agent handoff documents in English. Replies and product documentation follow the user's language and existing conventions.

## Complete the task

- Carry the requested outcome through implementation, relevant documentation, and verification. When requested, include browser validation, commits, pushes, or release work; do not stop at the first implementation. A review or diagnosis alone does not request a fix.
- Resolve routine choices from context. Ask only when missing information materially changes correctness, scope, or authorization; complete independent authorized work meanwhile. Carry prior authorization and corrections forward, including across side questions.
- User instructions take precedence over repository and skill guidance, subject to system and developer instructions. If a skill blocks authorized work, identify the exact file and instruction and explain the actual conflict.
- Read the affected implementation and relevant callers. Use the routing below when useful; do not read every document or load every skill for each edit.
- Reuse existing owners, helpers, patterns, and dependencies. Architectural extensions are appropriate when they support the requested capability; explain consequential tradeoffs and preserve unrelated work.
- Delegate independent, bounded work when it saves time or improves quality. Read-only agents may share this checkout; modifying agents need isolated worktrees based on the current local `HEAD`. Before delegation that writes code, read [parallel work](.agents/references/parallel-work.md).
- Verify changed behavior and run required checks. For low-impact changes, use lightweight checks; add regression tests when they exercise meaningful behavior. After checks pass, expand or repeat only for new changes, failures, or unresolved concerns. Do not repeat completed acceptance work simply because a task resumes.
- Review the final diff and run `git diff --check`. Report the result, relevant evidence, and precise remaining limitations concisely. Distinguish local checks from live browser results and remote CI.

## Project boundaries

- `apps/web` is a React/Vite SPA; `docs-site` is Vue/VitePress. Preserve each surface's framework and theme system.
- In `apps/web`, use semantic Tailwind classes backed by `apps/web/src/styles/shadcn.css` and `@theme inline`. CSS modules read `--sc-*`, never legacy `--color-*`. Do not add bare/arbitrary colors to `className`; canvas/data colors and shadow/overlay rgba are narrow exceptions.
- Use semantic status utilities such as `text-status-danger bg-status-danger-soft`, not paired hue classes. App dark mode uses `data-theme` and Tailwind `dark:`; do not introduce `.dark` there. The docs site intentionally uses `html.dark` and its own `--docs-*` / `--home-*` tokens. See [design system](docs-site/dev/reference/design-system.md).
- After app styling changes, run `pnpm --filter @anno/web lint:css-tokens` (also included in web lint). Prefer existing compact text sizes, semantic overlay layers, Lucide icons, and local UI adapters.
- Worktree `.env` and Node dependencies may be symlinks to the primary checkout. Check their targets before changing configuration or installing dependencies. Python environments and generated API types belong to the current checkout. See [runtime skill](.agents/skills/aap-runtime/SKILL.md).
- Celery does not hot-reload mounted Python code. Worker changes require refreshing affected running workers in the intended development stack and checking the new task/signature inside them. Dependencies or baked source require rebuilding; migrations require applying. Determine actual mounts and services first.
- Tests that seed or migrate databases must target a verified disposable test database. Follow the relevant test configuration; never assume the everyday development database is disposable.

## Documentation and releases

Before committing, update documentation affected by the change in the same commit:

| Change                      | Documentation                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API                         | `docs-site/api/`, `README.md`; regenerate affected API artifacts                 |
| Feature or user-visible fix | Relevant `docs-site/user-guide/` pages and top `CHANGELOG.md` Unreleased section |
| Architecture                | `docs-site/dev/concepts/`; ADR in `docs/adr/` when warranted                     |
| Environment variable        | `.env.example`, `pnpm docs:gen-env-vars`, `DEV.md`                               |
| Removed or renamed symbol   | Search Markdown references and update affected links                             |

Keep rendered documentation about the current system, without dotted version provenance such as `vX.Y.Z`. Put provenance in comments or frontmatter. Exceptions: `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/adr/**`, `docs-site/dev/adr/**`, and `*.generated.md`; runtime requirements, routes, and protocol versions remain valid.

`CHANGELOG.md` follows Keep a Changelog: `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security`, omitting empty groups. Explain user impact. Pure refactors, tests, and formatting may omit an entry. Release headings use `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD`, newest first.

Only bump versions for a requested release; use [aap-release](.agents/skills/aap-release/SKILL.md) for the synchronized version and OpenAPI workflow. `node scripts/check-doc-version-prefix.mjs --staged` is advisory. Plan filenames use `yyyy-mm-dd-<topic>.md`, or `yyyy-mm-dd-vx.y.z-<topic>.md` for versioned plans.

CI workflow files use `<domain>-<action>.yml`; the aggregate remains `ci.yml`. Top-level names use sentence case, preserving proper nouns and acronyms. Aggregate jobs set `name: <Domain> <tool/action>`; single-domain workflows rely on job ids. `scripts/check-workflow-names.mjs` checks these conventions.

## Task routing

Use only the relevant entry. Paths in skills are repository-relative unless linked otherwise.

`README.md` covers setup; `DEV.md` covers local commands. `docs-site/dev/` contains architecture, references and troubleshooting; `docs-site/ops/` contains deployment/runbooks. Use `docs/adr/README.md`, `docs/plans/README.md`, and `docs/research/README.md` to locate decisions, plans, and research. Preview docs with `pnpm docs:dev`; verify the actual URL printed by the server.

For a reported UI defect, inspect the affected flow's recent API calls and console errors. `BugReportDrawer` stores evidence in PostgreSQL `bug_reports`; [runtime diagnostics](.agents/skills/aap-runtime/references/diagnostics.md) gives a read-only fallback when an API token is unavailable.
