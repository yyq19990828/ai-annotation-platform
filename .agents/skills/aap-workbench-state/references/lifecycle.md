# Workbench lifecycle cases

## Layout and preferences

- Flush a retiring layout session's dirty snapshot to its original context; do not discard it when a new context becomes active. Serialize outstanding writes and prevent old responses from updating the new owner's state/cache.
- Read current schema constants and supported panels. Keep frontend and API validation consistent, including normalized integer floating bounds and context-specific panels.
- Newer/corrupt snapshots must retain recovery/read-only behavior. A restore failure must not silently overwrite the saved layout.
- Presentation groups differ from stored preference categories. When reorganizing settings, inspect `getFieldValue`, `buildFieldPatch`, and `lockableFieldName`; do not rename storage paths just to move a field.
- Keep project overrides separate from personal preferences. A display override must not be persisted as the user's own value.
- Exercise load failure/retry, rapid edits, save failure, unmount flush, and cross-user transitions when changing these paths.

## Editing and playback

- Trace keyboard, buttons, camera edits, numeric inputs, and propagation through the shared write guards. Disabled visible controls do not protect alternate entry points.
- Keep pending/invalid/saving/error states meaningful. Invalid input must cancel an older scheduled commit; task-lock responses and releases must not leak across tasks.
- Opening settings should pause video without snapping to a different frame when frame/draft stability is required. Inspect the existing playback controller's `snapToGrid` option.
- Scene playback waits for the intended frame to be ready. During task resolution, a temporary null task is not necessarily a terminal failure. Retain timeout and failure handling.
- Cancellation/rollback belongs to the current transaction owner; a child must not restore an old object's geometry into a newly selected object.
- Shared-query consumers should use the query lifecycle's cancellation signal rather than one consumer's private AbortController cancelling everyone.

## Tracker restoration

Refresh may begin before token hydration. Restoration must retry when authentication becomes usable, reconnect running jobs, and avoid duplicate subscriptions. Task switching during an in-flight preview/review request must not resurrect old candidates or emit old-task notifications.

Check socket/timer teardown and generation/task identity after awaits, including `enterReview` and preview fetches. Use the adjacent tracker tests and `apps/api/tests/test_video_tracker_jobs_list.py` for API-list semantics.

## Shared renderer and floating panels

One point-cloud renderer serves the main viewport and tri-views. Floating DOM layers, backgrounds, render overlays, clipping and pointer hit-testing must agree with the shared canvas. Do not introduce a second renderer to cover a layering bug. Inspect panel close/reopen and multiple overlapping floating groups as applicable.
