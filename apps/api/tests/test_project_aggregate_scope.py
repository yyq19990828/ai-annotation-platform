"""Pure SQL-contract tests for project-role aggregate scopes (Increment B3).

No database: the aggregate/delivery helpers must derive project scope from
``project_members`` and platform ownership, never from a legacy global staff
role, and a non-administrative owner must not receive the management arm.
