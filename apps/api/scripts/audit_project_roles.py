"""Read-only project-role discrepancy / reconciliation audit.

Increment A preparation for the project-scoped employee roles plan
(``docs/plans/1789807315_project-scoped-employee-roles.md``).  The CLI opens a
``REPEATABLE READ, READ ONLY`` transaction enforced by PostgreSQL and never
writes roles, memberships or assignments.

The audit also runs *before* revision 0173 exists.  It inspects
``information_schema`` for the additive preparation columns and substitutes
``NULL`` projections plus missing-evidence classifications, so reviewing a
production schema ahead of the migration is safe and reports unknown rather
than fabricating completeness.

Report shape (versioned JSON)::

    {
      "report_version": "project-role-audit/2",
      "run_id": "<uuid>",
      "generated_at": "<iso8601>",
      "read_only": true,
      "baseline": {...revisions, heads, available preparation columns...},
      "limits": {...},
      "summary": {...},
      "findings": {
        "role_discrepancies": {...},
        "assignment_membership_gaps": {...},
        "invitations": {...},
        "review_evidence": {...}
      },
      "reconciliation": {...}
    }

The report contains only IDs, roles, counts and timestamps.  It never emits
password hashes, invitation tokens, signed URLs or free-form reasons.

Usage::

    cd apps/api
    uv run python scripts/audit_project_roles.py --output /tmp/role-audit.json
    uv run python scripts/audit_project_roles.py --pretty

Exit codes:
    0  audit completed (findings never fail the command)
    2  the audit could not run (connection or schema error)
