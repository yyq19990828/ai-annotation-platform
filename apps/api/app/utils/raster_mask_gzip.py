"""v0.23.5 · ADR-0052 §D6 · gzip transport contract for ``coco_rle`` mask objects.

Mask canonical JSON can run into the MiB range for 4K / multi-instance masks.
The gzip transport layer keeps wire / object-storage size under control while
remaining backward compatible with the legacy uncompressed ``.json`` path.

Two boundaries are enforced on decompression to close the zip-bomb vector
(`ADR-0052 §D6 <docs/adr/0052-shared-raster-mask-and-image-geometry.md>`__):

- ``MAX_COMPRESSED_BYTES`` — total compressed bytes consumed.
- ``MAX_UNCOMPRESSED_BYTES`` — total decompressed bytes produced.
- ``MAX_EXPANSION_RATIO`` — ratio ceiling (``max_uncompressed / max_compressed``),
  enforced by the uncompressed cap combined with the ratio guard.

Streaming ``zlib.decompressobj`` (``wbits = MAX_WBITS | 16`` for gzip) lets us
abort the moment any cap is breached instead of materializing the full payload.

    ``raw`` is fed to ``zlib.decompressobj`` in chunks (so a hostile payload
    can't force us to materialize the full compressed buffer in one syscall).
    After each chunk we check:

    - the running compressed-byte count stays under ``max_compressed``;
    - the running decompressed-byte count stays under ``max_uncompressed``;
    - the (uncompressed / compressed) ratio stays under ``max_ratio`` — this
      is a sharper early-rejection than the absolute cap alone: a tiny
      compressed payload that already exceeds ``max_ratio`` is rejected even
      when it would fit the absolute cap, matching the ADR's intent.

    The ratio cap can also be expressed purely via ``max_uncompressed`` (a
    payload with ``compressed < max_uncompressed / max_ratio`` cannot reach
    ``max_uncompressed`` without violating ``max_ratio``). We enforce both
    explicitly so the rejection message names which limit was breached and so
    a future tuning change to either constant stays self-contained.
