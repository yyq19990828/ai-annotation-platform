"""Phase-aware project write authorization for asynchronous final writes (B3).

Long-running workers (cross-frame propagation, video tracker) must re-check the
*actual* task the write lands on, not the authority that was checked when work
was enqueued.  This module composes the existing canonical helpers:

* current project access (locked membership) from
  :mod:`app.services.project_access`;
* task editability and effective-assignee rules from
  ``app.api.v1.tasks._shared``;
* frozen review contributor evidence from
  :mod:`app.services.annotation_evidence`.

It deliberately adds no new policy language: an annotation-phase write requires
the effective annotator (or a manager), and a review-phase write requires a
reviewer/manager plus current, complete, non-self frozen evidence.
