"""v0.23.3 ADR-0050 §8 · MLBackendRouter — orchestrates DB topology + routing ledger.

The router sits between the project/pipeline (which requests a logical pool) and
``MLBackendClient`` (which transports to one physical instance). It:

1. validates the project has the pool enabled and the pool is enabled
2. reads DB topology under a single ``routing_generation`` (active members whose
   registry is connected, health-fresh, capability-fingerprint-matched)
3. queries the Redis ledger for currently-circuit-open instances
4. acquires a route lease atomically (SWRR + concurrency + circuit exclusion)
5. returns the selected ``MLBackendRegistry`` + ``RouteLease``

It does NOT issue HTTP. The caller builds ``MLBackendClient(selected_instance)``,
runs the request, then ``router.finish(lease, outcome)`` or ``router.cancel(lease)``
exactly once in a try/finally (ADR-0050 §13).

Rollout (D17): in ``off`` / ``observe`` the router returns the pool's
``legacy_instance_id`` without acquiring a lease (legacy dispatch); observe additionally
computes a shadow would-select for diagnostics. ``enforce`` fails closed on any
Redis/topology uncertainty.

Boundary: may import registry/pool models, the ledger, capability; must NOT import
API routers or workers (ADR-0050 §8).
