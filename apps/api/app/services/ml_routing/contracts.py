"""v0.23.3 ADR-0050 §B.3 · routing contracts: enums, dataclasses, error codes.

Frozen in P0 (plan appendix §B). P2/P3 implement against these types; deviation needs
an ADR amendment. These are pure data types — no Redis / DB / network access.

Key invariants (ADR-0050 D1-D18):
- pool id is the logical request identity; registry id is the physical execution identity.
- route lease is independent of GPU request lease (D7).
- only ``traffic_state=active`` members may receive new leases (D5).
- caller cancel ≠ transport failure: cancel never trips the passive circuit (D14).
