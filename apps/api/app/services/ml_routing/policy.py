"""v0.23.3 ADR-0050 §10.1 / §B.4 · smooth weighted round robin (SWRR) selection.

The only production scheduling policy in v0.23.3 (ADR-0050 D10). Pure functional core
(testable without Redis); the Redis acquire Lua mirrors this exact algorithm atomically
(see ``ledger.py``). Both must stay in lockstep — golden fixtures (§C.2) verify the
weight distribution and tie-break.

Algorithm (classic nginx SWRR):
1. For each eligible member: ``current_weight += configured_weight``.
2. Select the member with the largest ``current_weight``; ties broken by stable
   instance UUID (lexicographic) so the pick is deterministic across processes.
3. Selected member: ``current_weight -= total_eligible_weight``.
4. Members at max concurrency are excluded BEFORE weight advancement (they don't
   accrue weight while saturated — §10.1).
5. On membership/weight generation change, ``current_weight`` is reset for the new
   member set (the acquire Lua handles this via the generation check).
