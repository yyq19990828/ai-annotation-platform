"""v0.23.3 ADR-0050 §15 · topology + runtime-snapshot diagnostics for v0.23.4.

These read models are the contract v0.23.4's model-market UI consumes. They join
pool/member/registry/GPU/health by stable IDs (never by URL). topology is role-scoped
(Project Admin sees a trimmed view); runtime-snapshot is Super-Admin-only.

v0.23.4 enrichment (plan §1 / Appendix A.7 — read-only field fixes only):
* both builders return typed Pydantic models (``TopologyResponse`` /
  ``RuntimeSnapshotResponse``) so OpenAPI + generated TS types are real, not ``unknown``;
* topology carries derived ``routable_instances`` / ``status`` / ``status_reason_codes``;
* Project Admin projection is enforced server-side (``routing_policy="unknown"``,
  member ``weight`` / ``state`` / ``last_checked_at`` / ``gpu_resource_id`` → ``None``);
* runtime snapshot carries a freshness envelope (``observed_at`` / ``sources`` /
  ``partial`` / ``partial_reason``) per plan §6.3.

No routing-core changes: the router, route lease, selector and project binding
migration remain v0.23.3's. Metrics-driven fields stay ``None`` (plan §4.2 forbids
wiring shared route counters; v0.23.3's Prometheus module is declared but unwired).
