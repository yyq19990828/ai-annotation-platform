"""Increment A2 · durable annotation-phase contributor evidence.

The project-scoped employee roles plan needs a trustworthy record of *who*
contributed annotation-phase work to a task before any project-role model can
use that record for self-review.  This module owns the only writer of the
additive task fields introduced by the A1 schema revision:

* ``Task.annotation_contributor_ids`` — accumulated annotation-phase actors.
  ``None`` means completeness is **unknown** (legacy rows created before the
  recording binary, or a rolled-back recording interval).  ``[]`` means a
  known-empty set for a task created by the recording binary.  Any other list
  is the accumulated actor set.
* ``Task.review_contributor_ids`` — the contributor set frozen for the current
  ``review_round_id`` at submit/skip/batch-send/video completion.
* ``Task.review_submitter_id`` — the actor who actually submitted that round.

Recording is strictly additive in this increment: it never grants or denies
authorization, and it never changes first-review performance facts.

Unknown is sticky.  A later edit on a legacy task whose accumulator is ``NULL``
must not narrow it to a known set containing only the new actor, because the
missing history would be silently treated as complete.  Malformed evidence
(any non-list value, or a list containing a non-canonical user id) is treated
as unknown too, never silently dropped.

Locking policy
--------------

Producers must call :func:`record_annotation_actor` (or
:func:`record_annotation_actors_for_tasks`) **before** they take an Annotation
or SceneTrack row lock, because the existing writers already order
``Task -> Annotation``; a failed transaction rolls the evidence update back with
the mutation that failed.  Where a producer instead records after the mutation,
the task must already be locked first (for example the single-task
PATCH/DELETE endpoints).

Some producers are inherently mixed-order — an AAP import envelope, an
interpolation range, a resume, or a tracker accept cannot lock every task before
the resource rows without a repository-wide rewrite.  Those boundaries pass
``nowait=True``: the task row is acquired with ``FOR UPDATE NOWAIT`` and a busy
lock rolls the transaction back and surfaces a retryable 409 instead of
introducing a blocking wait cycle.  See
``app/services/user_lifecycle.py`` for the same nonblocking conflict pattern.
