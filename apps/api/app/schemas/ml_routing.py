"""v0.23.4 ADR-0050 §3 · typed read models for the model-market UI.

These Pydantic schemas replace the untyped ``dict`` returns of
``build_topology`` / ``build_runtime_snapshot`` so that:

* the OpenAPI snapshot exposes real component schemas (not ``object``),
* the generated TypeScript types are named and typed (not ``unknown``),
* role projection (Project Admin vs Super Admin) is enforced by the schema
  field defaults rather than by key omission,
* a freshness envelope (``observed_at`` / ``stale`` / ``partial`` /
  ``sources``) is part of the contract per plan §3.2/§6.3.

Conventions mirror ``app.schemas.ml_backend``: PEP 604 unions, ``Literal``
for closed enumerations, ``Field(default_factory=...)`` for collections,
and ``None`` defaults for absent/projected-away fields.
